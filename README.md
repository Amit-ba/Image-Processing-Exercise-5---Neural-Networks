# Image-Processing-Exercise-5---Neural-Networks
Neural Networks for image restoration

In this exercise, we have built a ResNet nerual network with Keras, and used it to train a network for image restoration. 

In addition I have implemented the bonus - a verison of Deep Image Prior based on the ResNet architecture. In bonus_ex5.pdf I have explained about Deep Image Prior.
